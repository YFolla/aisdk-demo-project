# Phase 6: Auto-Routing and Fallbacks

**Goal**: Implement intelligent auto-routing that analyzes requests and automatically selects the optimal execution mode (Tools vs Agents), with fallback strategies and transparent decision-making. This phase completes the AI Lab with fully autonomous operation.

**Duration**: 4-5 days

**Success Criteria**: 
- Auto-router accurately analyzes request complexity and selects appropriate mode
- Fallback mechanisms work when agents exceed time/cost thresholds
- Decision criteria and routing logic are transparent in Developer View
- System learns from user feedback to improve routing decisions
- Performance metrics guide continuous router optimization

## Key Components

### Request Analyzer
```typescript
// lib/routing/request-analyzer.ts
export async function analyzeRequest(
  request: string, 
  context: ConversationContext
): Promise<RequestAnalysis> {
  const analysis = await generateObject({
    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo-preview'),
    prompt: `Analyze this request for routing: "${request}"`,
    schema: z.object({
      complexity: z.number().min(0).max(1),
      domains: z.array(z.enum(['search', 'analysis', 'generation', 'planning'])),
      timeEstimate: z.number(),
      requiresMultiStep: z.boolean(),
      confidenceLevel: z.number().min(0).max(1)
    })
  })

  return {
    ...analysis.object,
    recommendation: analysis.object.complexity > 0.7 ? 'agents' : 'tools',
    reasoning: `Complexity: ${analysis.object.complexity}, Multi-step: ${analysis.object.requiresMultiStep}`
  }
}
```

### Auto Router
```typescript
// lib/routing/auto-router.ts
export class AutoRouter {
  async route(request: string, context: RoutingContext): Promise<RoutingDecision> {
    const analysis = await analyzeRequest(request, context)
    const userPrefs = await getUserPreferences(context.userId)
    
    // Apply routing logic
    const decision = this.makeRoutingDecision(analysis, userPrefs, context)
    
    // Log decision for learning
    await this.logRoutingDecision(decision, analysis)
    
    return decision
  }

  private makeRoutingDecision(
    analysis: RequestAnalysis,
    preferences: UserPreferences,
    context: RoutingContext
  ): RoutingDecision {
    const scores = {
      tools: this.calculateToolsScore(analysis, preferences),
      agents: this.calculateAgentsScore(analysis, preferences)
    }

    const selectedMode = scores.agents > scores.tools ? 'agents' : 'tools'
    
    return {
      mode: selectedMode,
      confidence: Math.abs(scores.agents - scores.tools),
      reasoning: this.generateReasoning(scores, analysis),
      fallbackPlan: this.createFallbackPlan(selectedMode, analysis)
    }
  }
}
```

### Fallback System
```typescript
// lib/routing/fallback-system.ts
export class FallbackSystem {
  async monitorExecution(
    executionId: string,
    mode: ExecutionMode,
    thresholds: FallbackThresholds
  ): Promise<void> {
    const monitor = setInterval(async () => {
      const status = await getExecutionStatus(executionId)
      
      if (this.shouldFallback(status, thresholds)) {
        await this.executeFallback(executionId, mode, status)
        clearInterval(monitor)
      }
    }, 1000)
  }

  private shouldFallback(
    status: ExecutionStatus,
    thresholds: FallbackThresholds
  ): boolean {
    return (
      status.elapsedTime > thresholds.maxTime ||
      status.estimatedCost > thresholds.maxCost ||
      status.confidence < thresholds.minConfidence
    )
  }

  private async executeFallback(
    executionId: string,
    originalMode: ExecutionMode,
    status: ExecutionStatus
  ): Promise<void> {
    const fallbackMode = originalMode === 'agents' ? 'tools' : 'agents'
    
    // Cancel original execution
    await cancelExecution(executionId)
    
    // Start fallback execution
    await startFallbackExecution(executionId, fallbackMode, status.request)
    
    // Notify user of fallback
    await notifyFallback(executionId, originalMode, fallbackMode, status.reason)
  }
}
```
